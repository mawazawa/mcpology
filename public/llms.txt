# MCPology LLMs.txt

## Purpose
MCPology is the definitive reference site for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, documenting which servers work reliably and which ones will break your Claude Code CLI with schema validation errors.

## Audience
- Vibe Coders who value working software over configuration hell
- Developers building with Claude Code CLI or Claude Desktop
- Anyone who has spent 45 minutes debugging "input_schema does not support oneOf, allOf, or anyOf"
- Pioneers exploring the MCP ecosystem

## Key Features
- **The Blacklist**: MCP servers that cause schema validation errors, with exact error messages and dates
- **The Whitelist**: Battle-tested MCPs with reliability ratings and tier system
- **Personal Favorites**: Curated MCP combinations for specific use cases
- **The Memory MCP Double-Dipping Incidentâ„¢**: A cautionary tale from June 26, 2025

## Important Context
Many MCP servers use complex JSON schemas that are incompatible with Claude Code CLI's strict validation. The error "input_schema does not support oneOf, allOf, or anyOf at the top level" has become the bane of many developers' existence. This site documents which servers trigger these errors.

## Technical Details
- Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and brutalist design principles
- Server-side rendered for AI crawler compatibility
- No JavaScript required to view content
- Mobile-first, fat-finger friendly design

## Creator
Created by d16p ventures after the infamous Memory MCP debugging session at 2 AM PDT on June 26, 2025.

## Philosophy
"Devs Don't Kill My Vibe" - We believe in software that works, not software that requires a PhD in JSON Schema to configure.

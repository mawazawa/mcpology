## The Great Memory MCP Double-Dipping Incidentâ„¢

On June 26, 2025, at 2:00 AM PDT, what should have been a simple production deployment turned into a 45-minute debugging odyssey. The culprit? Memory MCP was "double-dipping" - running in multiple config files AND as zombie processes, causing schema validation errors that blocked every single command in Claude Code CLI.
